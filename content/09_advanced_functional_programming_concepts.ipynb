    "- A [Functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor) in functional programming is a type that implements a map operation, which applies a function to a wrapped value.\n",

    "- Functors must obey two laws: identity (if we map the id function over a functor, the functor that we get back should be the same as the original functor) and composition (composing two functions and then mapping the resulting function over a functor should be the same as first mapping one function over the functor and then mapping the other one).\n",
    "- They are used to abstract over data types that can be mapped over, and provide a consistent interface for applying functions to values in a context."
